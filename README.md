# The Path to Camelot

Well met, Traveler! You are Rowan the Swift. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find the magical healing elixir in the city of Camelot. It's imperative that you are quick about it because the King's daughter's life is at stake. Along the way, you will have the opportunity to pick up coins and healing potions to boost your health stats. Various scoundrels and thieves from Avalon will try to thwart you, but you mustn't let them. 

To win, you must get the elixir to the King within a 10 minute time frame with at least 10 HP. Do try not to die, young knight.

Main things I want in the game:

- Method to "pick up" objects
- Check if arrow keys, "a", or <SPACE> pressed
- How do attacks occur?
- Walls (ie, places characters can't walk)
- Win screen
- Varying difficulties with the enemies
